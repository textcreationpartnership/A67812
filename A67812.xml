         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Author of the following Animadverſions, obſerving with great Regret, his Art abuſed, and its rules, and methods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly repreſented by the Impudent ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medicaſters of the Age and Nation, whereby <hi>Tyro's</hi> and young men are tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and miſled into ill Principles, and infected with erroneous Inſtitutions; thought it his duty to take upon him, not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the deceivers, but ſet things right, and rectify the abuſes, in the ſame publique manner they were made, and becauſe none among the many blind guides, this age hath produced, ſeems ſo obnoxious, and proves ſo confident an impoſer of falſe principles, or

            <p>And if among other abuſes he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to redreſs, he hath contributed any thing to the breaking that deceitful practice, <hi>of famous mens gilding poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Books with imprimaturs,</hi> and ſtaking their ſtarling credit in vouch of baſe coin, and by prefixing their known names, ſet off, and make vendible rotten Books, he

            <p>I am ſorry and aſhamed, men ſhould be ſo regardleſs of their own credit, ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſgent in matters of publique importance, ſo unjuſt to their friend, (if they are ſuch whom they applaud,) and act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o much like <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:44426:5"/>making large <hi>Encomiums,</hi> on notorious cheats, and praiſe to the People, what would miſchief them if they uſe it.</p>
            <p>This is not ſaid with any deſign to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, but to reprove them, for that deteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtom, which ſprang from a ſort of People I am loath to name, and they would be aſhamed to imitate, I beg pardon for having ſaid thus much, it was neceſſary for me to remove the only thing that looks reputably in the writings of our impoſture, and take off their varniſh, the better to expoſe the rottenneſs it hides, were I ſure they would excuſe this juſt freedom, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould be as certain of his Antagoniſts, of which however if he be very greedy, and deſirous, undoubtedly his Encomiaſter Mr. <hi>G—y,</hi> by the help of the Stars, can inform him.</p>
            <p>Certainly this undertaking of my friend, though it be ſevere, is not ungenerous; Its every honeſt mans duty to be a Champion for truth, and reſcue mankind from ſuch miſchievous errors, as thoſe pernicious and anskilful inſtitutions convey, for being like common Nuſances, the law alloweth every man a right to remove, and deſtroy them, at leaſt to antidote ſuch venemous poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being of dayly uſe, may in tract of time deſtroy more lives, than deſeaſe,
<pb facs="tcp:44426:5"/>or battle. An error of this nature, is not like thoſe in <hi>Geometry, Aſtronomy,</hi> or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of meer ſpeculation, wherein a man may err without hurt to himſelf, or others, but like poyſoning of fountains, of infinite danger to the publique, and therefore every good mans duty, and intereſt to ſuppreſs, and prevent from ſpreading.</p>
            <p>But althô I do approve, I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently prevail with my ſelf, to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this undertaking, not that the man is any way terrible, but from an opinion I had, that it was as needleſs as its object was contemptible, his faults and follies, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought were ſo manifeſt, his thefts ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, his vaunts and pretences, ſo plainly precarious, that I could not think they would eſcape the obſervation, and cenſure of wiſemen, and for others, I thought them too like him, to receive any impreſſions to his prejudice.</p>
            <p>I thought it alſo an unmanly quarrel, and a conqueſt that would deſerve no glory, or triumph, to overcome a man una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to weild his ſword, or manage his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; its too much like killing a dead man, or a late Authors writing a Book, <hi>to confute a man he thought had no brains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſide which, I was diſcouraged by the

            </p>
            <p>This may ſeem a rude abuſive Treatment, and bold Cenſure, to thoſe who look no farther, than the ſparkiſh Picture, and florid appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the man, and read not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the wheedlings, precarious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of his Approvers, but let any Impartial Artiſt purſue him, and with an ordinary heed ſurvey his writings,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44426:31"/>if he find he deſerves better uſage, or do not diſcover him wretchedly Thieviſh, and notoriouſly defective, and ignorant, that he hath equall'd the moſt faulty Author, I will have that Imputation and Character, and ſuffer the chaſtiſement due to him for abuſing the world, and putting on them an indigeſted Fardle of other mens works, as his own.</p>
            <p>Had he treated us as an Artiſt ought, written with the becomming qualifications of a uſeful good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and given us ſomewhat new, as did <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the firſt Writers, and thoſe who even in this Age, have found new ſubjects for their Pens, as <hi>Harvey, Malpighius,</hi> and many <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus's</hi> in <hi>Phyſick, Chyrurgery,</hi> or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy;</hi> or had he corrected the errours, evinced the miſtakes, explained the meaning, or ſupplied the defects of other Writers, as did <hi>Galen,</hi> and the many Commentators on <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (beſide divers Neoterick Authors,) had he abridged the copious, like Dr. <hi>Read, Blaſius,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Gibſon;</hi> had he collected the choice of many Authors, as did <hi>Schenkius, Moronus, Burnet, Bonetus, Gualterus,</hi> &amp;c. had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44426:31"/>he ſtrengthened the Principles, and confirmed the Methods of Art, by new <hi>Theories, Experiments</hi> or <hi>Remedies,</hi> like <hi>Sanctorius, Willis, Quercetan, Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus, VViſeman, Meckeren, Bartholine; &amp;c.</hi> and many more; had he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated conſtant Methods to new diſcoveries, or revived ſome obſolete, and worn-out way of cure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> grown undeſervedly out of uſe, as hath <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus, Blaſius,</hi> Dr <hi>Harris,</hi> and the Anſwerers of <hi>Medela Medicinae,</hi> he had been praiſe worthy; and merited thoſe Impertinent <hi>Encomiums,</hi> he prefixeth ſo fondly to his Books.</p>
            <p>But, Sr, we ſee nothing like this, on the contrary his works are <hi>twice ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cabbage,</hi> nothing <hi>new,</hi> nothing <hi>his own,</hi> ſcarce a medicin, or an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or a notion but is ecchoed; nay he is ſo ridiculous a <hi>Plagiary,</hi> that he doth not repreſent fairly to us the things he ſteales, nor hath he for want of ſkill to chooſe taken the beſt to be had, among the Authors from whom he filtcht,) which is to me an argument of his low parts, and mean abilities; to ſteal the crudities, and corruptions of Books, argues that things of an ingenious nature, are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44426:32"/>not agreeable to him, and is like Childrens ſtealing Rattles and Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, from among Jewels and things of worth, <hi>ſecundum modum recipientis.</hi> Thus I ſay, our Author is ſo unfit to write Books, that he gives us nothing new, all from others, and that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, either of it ſelf Ill, or made ſo by his awkward way of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, impertinently and lamely uſed, not at all to the purpoſe. In ſhort, <hi>things old, ſtoln, and borrowed; things abſurd, jejune, and nugatory, collected in a very rude</hi> (though he call it a <hi>new</hi>) <hi>method, or rather confuſion, in a broken ſtyle and way full of Rambles, and ſtrange Tranſitions,</hi> as if his wits were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Wooll, <hi>is</hi> (with <hi>Tautologies, ſilly Metaphors,</hi> and <hi>unintelligible Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>) <hi>the compoſition of his Book,</hi> and the man (notwithſtanding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and opinion of himſelf and friends, an <hi>Ignorant Plagiary</hi> and moſt <hi>Ridiculous Scribler,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Juſtice of this Cenſure, I will manifeſt to you very plainly without a rigid, or particular ſurvey of all he hath written, and without ſqueezing or putting any thing to the <hi>Rack,</hi> and here I muſt profeſs copiouſneſs of matter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44426:32"/>which is uſually an advantage, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me an Impediment. I am choaked with plentitude. He is ſo all over vanity, that I know not where to begin; his Follies are ſo perplext, I know not how to unravel them, without being as Immethodical, and appearing as great a Bungler as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I will begin as he doth, and attack his <hi>Compleat Treatiſe</hi> of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which being the firſt broaching of his <hi>Hog-s Head,</hi> his freſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, Effort may be preſumed moſt nervy and ſtrong, and give us the greateſt difficulty to encounter and ſubdue.</p>
            <p>This Book we find by the Authors Picture, was written in the 35th year of his age, which I ſuppoſe is pointed to us, that we may admire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Sagacity and great abilities of ſo young a man. His Title-Page calls it a <hi>Compleat diſcourſe of Tumors. Compleat</hi> either to diſtinguiſh it from others who have written defectively on that Subject, or elſe a ſlye ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as if he had ſaid all that Subject was capable of, or perhaps becauſe it hath diſcourſed of all the diſeaſes, compellated under thoſe Titles; how
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44426:33"/>little it deſerves that Character, on either of theſe accounts will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonſtrated in the enſuing Pages, and that on the contrary its empty, defective, ſtoln for the moſt part from imperfect, erroneous, and obſolete Writings, abounding with vanities, errours, contradictions, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, impertinences, and more faults, than any Book of its bigneſs, of a Subject ſo common and eaſy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſuch plenitude of excellent precedents and guides.</p>
            <p>Its ſcarce credible, that any man ſhould be ſo blockiſh, as this, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude on the World under thoſe Titles, things ſo little deſerving them; nor leſs ſurpriſing is it, to ſee a Book ſo full of Palpable errours, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt evidences of a ſilly Illiterate Author, containing nothing Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or valuable, full of the Scum, and Crudities of their Notions, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and Obſervations, who were long ſince exceeded, and exploded, to ſee ſuch things proclaimed <hi>uſeful, commendable, ingenious, learned, elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> &amp;c. by men that knew better, and from whoſe Sagacity, his egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errours, manifeſt faults, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errations,

            <p>As to his Inſtance from <hi>History; viz.</hi> the Phyſicians Embalming <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> it's not at all to his purpoſe, being 2000 years after the Creation, as were the Diſeaſes ſaid to be among the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> as to his opinion, that Healing was invented before other Arts, it's not only deſtitute of proof but probability, at leaſt where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>viz the holy Scripture,</hi> where it's plain, that <hi>Agriculture, making Tents, Muſick, Artifice in Braſs and Iron,</hi> were ſoon upon the Creation, as is recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. but not one word of <hi>Diſeaſes, Hurts,</hi> or <hi>Healers.</hi> Beſide which, before the days of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it's probable there were only ſome Emperical Practiſers, that all the skill lay in ſuch hands, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,

            <p>His ſixth Chapter is of Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, (how pertinent here, I need not ſay.)

            <p>Thus, Sir, in defence of my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Apologie for my caution,

            <p>It cannot be a <hi>compleat Treatiſe</hi> of Tumors, becauſe it treats not of all the diſeaſes properly ſo called, and very defectively and erroneouſly of thoſe it doth, the later I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evinced; as to the former, he omits <hi>Priapiſmus, Polypus Cordis, Arthritis nodoſa, Anchylops,</hi> and ſome Tumors about the eyes. <hi>Spina Ventoſa, Variola, Hyperſarcoſis, Teſtudo, Phymoſis, Paraphymoſis, Gangleon, Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, Cryſtae, Condyloma, Exitus ani, Procidentia Vaginae &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri, gutta Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacea, Elephantiaſis, Impetigo, Ecchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis, Varex, Pernio, Furuncle, Epy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyctis, Terminthus, Tympany, Gibboſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the joints in the Rickets and Gowt, Tumors Symptomatical to wounds,</hi>

            <p>His Impertinent Chapters, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Subjects not properly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended among Tumors, are that of <hi>Phlebotomy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcerate Cancers, Herpes exedens, Tinea, Cataract, Gangreen,</hi> and <hi>Spacelus,</hi> becauſe they are often without ſwellings, and uſe not to be computed among them.</p>
            <p>His Obſervations, are ſome of them quoted (though ſtoln at ſecond hand) from <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Albucaſis, Aetius, Celſus, Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abbas, Rhaſis,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch as were very ancient; the reſt are either from <hi>Vigo, Schenkius, Aqua pendente, Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus, Benivenius, Fallopius, Hildan us, Foreſtus, Guido, Laurentius, Luſitanus, Placentinus, Tagaultius, Pareus, Vigie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> Who, (and their contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries,) he calls the Ancients. <hi>Page</hi> 216. of his Book of wounds, many of them wrote above 200, moſt of above one hundred years ſince, all of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44426:60"/>them before this age, there then remaines, as truly modern, of all his Catalogue, only <hi>Banniſter, Crook, Read, Wharton,</hi> and <hi>Barbet,</hi> the two former are accounted old, and long ſince dead, ſo is Dr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Read,</hi> but allowing them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, and add <hi>Barbet,</hi> they have not yeilded him one in ten of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and <hi>Schenckius</hi> more than altogether, ſo that contrary to his <hi>Mounte-Banck Title-Page,</hi> inſtead of moſt of the obſervations being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, they are almoſt all old, yea very Ancient.</p>
            <p>His Book of <hi>Wounds,</hi> we find writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when he was a year older, tho' not a jot wiſer, than when he hatcht that of Tumors, one years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath not ſtrengthned his reaſon, added Nerves to his Judgment, or bettered his acquiſitions; we find ſome alteration in his face by the picture, but not a whit in his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the diſcourſe, although with his wonted vanity, he calls it alſo <hi>Compleat.</hi> Indeed he runs his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into as great a number, and the Treatiſe into as many diviſions, as I have met in any Book, mincing them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44426:60"/>ſo, that he gives us one Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>wounds of Arteries and veins,</hi> and another for <hi>wounds of the veins and Arteries,</hi>

I know ſome others have been very nice and particular, I wiſh our Author had out-don them in other things, that he might juſtly claim the Epithite, he hath given his Book, ſurely we have had in our own age, and Mother-Tongue, Books of wounds, leſs incompleat, (unleſs unneceſſary diviſion, be a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) and our preſumptuous Ignorant, venturing to appear on the Stage (like a <hi>farce,</hi> following an excellent <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>) after thoſe, whom he was not able to imitate, much leſs <hi>excel,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be hiſt off again.</p>
            <p>How fit he was to perform the promiſe of his Title-Page, and write Books, he gives you an early demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, in that <hi>Farrago,</hi> which he begins with, and calls <hi>Chirurgical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions as touching wounds,</hi> than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44426:61"/>which perhaps there never was ſo confuſed and impertinent a thing; words jumbled together like lots, and thrown out by chance, would cohere as pertinently, and as much to the purpoſe, as this <hi>gally mawfry,</hi> a pretty teacher of young Chirurgeons, that had need be taught himſelf the firſt Principles of the Art, of which he undertakes to Write <hi>Compleat Books.</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44426:61"/>two of which might have ſerved any purpoſe as well as this for which he deſigns them, one is from <hi>Albucas,</hi> of a Woman ſhot into the Belly with an arrow, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of the wound; another from <hi>Gilbertus Anglicus,</hi> of a man ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the guts with an Arrow alſo, which was DRAWN FORTH with the excrements, can any mortal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle the uſe of theſe ſtories here, and make them any way pertinent, in a dehortation from a ſpeedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of Bullets, or extraneous body from out of a wound; the third from <hi>Alſaharavius,</hi> he quotes falſe <hi>Tract.</hi> 6. inſtead of the 16. and all of them (according to his wonted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity) ſtoln from <hi>Schenkius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame rate he treats, <hi>of the difference of weapons,</hi> ſome (quoth he,) are taken from their <hi>figure, round,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>having</hi> SHARP <hi>points.</hi> — Some from their <hi>habits,</hi> ſome of which are SHARP <hi>pointed,</hi> — is not this pure Logick, to make an <hi>Identity,</hi> a <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;</hi> he then only names the pocket-Inſtruments, and over again the great ones, together with the names, and a conciſe account of the natures of

Mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus</hi> (quoth he,) <hi>partly mollifies, and partly digeſts, and in ſome meaſure doth ſuppurate, it is generally reckoned among the emollients and ſuppurative.</hi> Surely I need not tell you, where the Impertinence and Tautologie of this paſſage lyeth, I know I write to an Artiſt, and a man of ſenſe, to whom a bare repreſentation of his faulty paſſages, without comment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But if you will behold the moſt ſuperlative Nonſenſe and Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that perhaps ever iſſued from the pen of any Writer, read that train of hard words, which he calls, <hi>the Appropriation of Medicine.</hi> I ſhould undoubtedly believe them ſtoln from ſome <hi>Lexicon,</hi> or <hi>Phyſical Dictionary,</hi> if I had ever ſeen one ſo abſurd, for here are <hi>Medical</hi> and <hi>Chirurgical Termes,</hi> and <hi>Remedies promiſcuouſly,</hi> without reſpect to parts, or Alphabet, obtruded among <hi>Chyrurgical Inſtitutions as touching wounds,</hi> and many of them ſo falſly explained as ſheweth the prodigious Ignorance of the Publiſher.

            <p>He finiſheth thoſe his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> (as he calls them) with old fulſom diſtinctions of wounds, (which he pretends he had from <hi>Galen, Avicen, Guido,</hi> &amp;c. When in all probability, he went no further for them than <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>) which ſhews him a ſtranger to the more conciſe and polite faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the age, which rejects all ſuch impertinent and unneceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, becauſe they (for the moſt part) conſiſt of accidental not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial differences, and are of themſelves not really uſeful in cure, or enable an Artiſt a whit the better, to ſerve his Patient, but are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Ancient Writers, in the compliance with the rules and nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their other ſtudies and ways of erudition, this he might have found ſuggeſted by two of the lateſt, (and

            <p>At length after many hard words, he lets his Reader paſs on to the Book it ſelf, where he entertains us with a rant againſt ſuch as you make no difference between a ſimple and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound wound, but tells us not where the man is to be found that hath been guilty of this foul error. I believe he never knew it aſſerted by any mortal, but ſuggeſts it.

(to which they are ſo naturally incident,) and to what himſelf delivers in another place, but to Reaſon and Philoſophy, Warmth, and Humidity moſt aptly occaſioning Putrifaction, as is evident in Wounds, Cadavers, &amp;c.

            <p>Page 32 and 131, he erroneouſly prefers (and quotes <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for it,) the <hi>Diagnoſtick</hi> part of Art to the <hi>Curative,</hi> or <hi>Therapeutick.</hi> Calling it the laudable part of Practice, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is a <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> is the moſt Eligible, let all the Authors in the World ſay the contrary, the moſt uſeful is the moſt neceſſary, and the Curative part, (to whichall the reſt ſubſerve and tend,) moſt lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

            <p>He fetcheth almoſt all his Prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks from the Ancient Writers, who were Strangers to the cure of thoſe Wounds and diſeaſes that are now frequent, this is one cauſe why he falls into ſo many errors, when he comes to Preſages, as I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion elſewhere to obſerve. At preſent I will ſingle out only one, and that the moſt likely to be true, as having much reaſon, and agreeing with the common <hi>Phaenomna,</hi> the ſenſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, and opinion of moſt men in this, viz. <hi>That Wounds of the Heart are abſolutely mortal, and incurable.</hi> This noble Intral ſeems the only part of the Body, which being hurt brings inevitable death, for reaſons which our Author hath ſtolen from <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> and <hi>Read;</hi> its in his 60th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 77. He poſitively and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception ſaith, an <hi>Ecchymoſis muſt be ſuppurated,</hi> and ſoon after directs to a method for reſolving them. <hi>Page</hi> 21, 169, 245, 304. and elſewhere, <hi>he dehorts the Chirurgion from medling with ſuch cures, as he hath no Authority or encouragement from Art to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with.</hi> But <hi>Page</hi> 100, 132, 138, 163, 305, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being in a better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, adviſeth to the contrary, and perſuades him not to forſake any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, or be diſcouraged, in the moſt deſperate caſes. <hi>Page</hi> 113. <hi>He forbids the uſe of moiſt things to parts without the Scull.</hi> And ſoon upon it, directs to Wine, (which is actually ſuch,) and Oil of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Wort, Yelks of Eggs, which are both actually and potentially ſuch. <hi>Page</hi> 129. <hi>Hot and moiſt Conſtitutions are not ſo apt for admittance of Putrifaction.</hi> Yet, <hi>Page</hi> 72, 73. he affirms, that thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which procure it, are all of that temper. Page 28. <hi>When the Skin is broken, he decryeth the uſe of Oiles.</hi> And yet in many places directs the uſe of them in Wounds, ſo <hi>Page</hi> 36.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44426:91"/>He is at it again, <hi>diſſuading from the uſe of unctuous Salves, eſpecially where Conſolidation is to be performed, becauſe</hi> Page 40. <hi>Oils do hinder Agglutination.</hi> Yet in <hi>Page</hi> 42.

He ſaith pain and heat do attend the part, while digeſtion is performing; and inflammation encreaſeth, while matter is making. Page 136. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on thoſe who divide the Art into many parts.</hi> When he himſelf is not only guilty of all the ſuperfluous min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing extant, but exceeded them, in giving two Chapters for one ſubject, tho' the Title be ſomewhat diverſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. See Chap. 60, 61. Page 134. He ſaith, <hi>if a Feaver happen on Wounds of the Head, before the fourteenth day, its a deadly ſign.</hi> And in the very next period makes the like danger to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch, to which a Feaver ſupervenes after that time. Page 129. He ſaith, <hi>Childrens Heads wounded are not ſo apt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44426:91"/>for Putrifaction;</hi> and <hi>Page</hi> 137. A more ſpeedy purulency of matter happens in them, than in Perſons of age; and to ſtrengthen the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction beyond all excuſe, he gives the ſame reaſon for the one, that he doth for the other, viz. <hi>Heat and moiſture,</hi> making it in the one the cauſe, why Putrifaction and digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is tedious, and in the other, more ſpeedy and quick. Page 160. His Doctrine, and adviſe in the firſt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, is not only very inartificial and abſurd, but contradicted in the next, and the ſubſequent ſtory. Page 273, 275, &amp;c. <hi>He calls the Heart, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life, the Prince of the Bowels, the chief Engine, and yet</hi> Page 178.

He abſurdly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. <hi>That Putrifaction, and Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus of the Brain are deadly Symptomes, not to be found out by the opening of the Scull, after the Party be dead,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gainſaith it by an inſtance from <hi>Volch Coiterus,</hi> (ſtoln from <hi>Skenckius. Page</hi> 24,) of many diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where more than half the Brain was putrifyed, the Ventricles full of foetid green matter, and in the <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:44426:92"/>very putrid Apoſthumes. Page 188. <hi>He forbids the uſe of cooling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent things to the Head, in concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Brain.</hi> Not only contrary to almoſt all Authors, but his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate direction of a <hi>Cataplaſm</hi> of that temper and quality, he ſaith, (the ſame Page) <hi>reſtringents are not to be uſed, becauſe they hinder the exhalation of the fuliginous Vapors, through the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And in the very <hi>Page,</hi> not only directs to the uſe of Repulſives, and to have them continued the firſt four days, but a Fomentation and a Plaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (ſtoln from <hi>A Pary, lib.</hi> 10, <hi>cap.</hi> 22.) which are both of them <hi>binding</hi> or <hi>reſtrictive,</hi> as you may ſee by the Ingredients, <hi>Orris, Lalam.

Page 254. He reckons (very erroneouſly) <hi>extruſion of the air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through wounds of the Breaſt, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſign of Penetration.</hi> And in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44426:92"/>ſame Chapter, gives a ſtory to the contrary. Page 256. <hi>He directs to the uſe of Vinegar to diſcuſs and diſſolve Blood, caſt into the Breaſt from a Wound, ſo as it may be expectorated.</hi> And yet in the next <hi>Page</hi> ſaith, ſuch Blood muſt neceſſarily and ſpeedily be ſuppurated. <hi>Page</hi> 257, 258.

Page 25, 266, 267. <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth lingring death at leaſt to Wounds of the Lungs.</hi> And yet not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directs to their cure, but reports two ſtories from <hi>Glandorp,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtoln from <hi>Skenckius</hi> of prodigious Wounds there cured. <hi>Page</hi> 271. He makes Wounds of the <hi>Pericardium</hi> eaſily curable, and in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaith, <hi>that they generally bring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, hectick Fever, ard death.</hi> Page 273. <hi>He Prognoſticates preſent death to Wounds of the Heart.</hi> And confeſſeth in the ſame Chapter, not only that a man may ſurvive ſuch a

Page 278. <hi>The great Arterie wounded, the Body grows chill.</hi> Although in that very Chapter he delivers, that a Feaver and Inflammation are ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of that Wound. He ſaith, page 279. <hi>The Veins carry Blood to the Heart;</hi> and page 275 he affirms, that it doth not receive from any part, <hi>that its diſputable, whether the Veins have their Original from the Heart or Liver;</hi> and on the contrary affirms in divers places, that they have their Original in the Liver. <hi>Page</hi> 297. he ſaith, <hi>The Gut Jejunum is exſanguial,</hi> and in the ſame breath ſaith; <hi>page</hi> 298. they are full of Veſſels, and that the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of Meſeraick Veins doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſh it from the great Guts. Pagr 304. <hi>He denounceth abſolute death to large Wounds of the Liver;</hi> and in the ſame Chapter relates from <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp,</hi> the Cure of one, who loſt great part thereof; and another from <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> of one who loſt a leſs piece and was cured. Page 309. <hi>Death</hi> (quoth he) <hi>ſoon followeth if the Stomach be cut;</hi> although in the ſame Chapter he not only confeſſeth ſuch Wounds
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44426:93"/>are curable, but gives a borrowed ſtory from <hi>Glandorp,</hi> and two ſtoln from <hi>Sckenkius,</hi> of moſt prodigious ones healed. Page 24. <hi>He repreſents the ſubſtance of the Liver, as grumous, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Blood;</hi> and yet <hi>page</hi> 302. he ſaith once and again, that the ſame whole ſubſtance is a compoſition of <hi>Glandules</hi> and <hi>Ramifications.</hi> Again, in the ſame page he ſuggeſts (as he doth in many other places,) <hi>Sanguification is performed by the Liver,</hi> and again ſaith the contrary. <hi>Page</hi> 237. He ſaith, <hi>If the Tongue be wounded tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, it's altogether incurable,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in the ſame page, that it's to be accounted curable, if it be not wholly cut off; as he exemplifieth by a borrowed (though falſly quoted) ſtory from <hi>Hildanus.</hi> Page 233. <hi>He relates the ſtory of a Souldier ſhot through the middle of the Ear,</hi> but preſently forgetting himſelf, ſaith, the <hi>Cartilage</hi> was not hurt. <hi>Page</hi> 140. He ſaith, <hi>Inciſion cannot, ought not, to be made through the temporal Muſcle;</hi> and <hi>page</hi> 225. directs to it, as a thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and feaſible.

            <p>His <hi>Robberies,</hi> as to <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> are moſtly from <hi>Sckenkius;</hi> and to be thought of plenary and various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he quotes not the Book whence he had them, but the quotations, as he finds them in the <hi>Collector.</hi> I know this were very uncertain to me, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe divers men may quote original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one and the ſame Author,) if I did not find all the Errours, miſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are in <hi>Schenkius,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly tranſcribed by our <hi>Plagiary,</hi> of which hereafter you ſhall have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances.
